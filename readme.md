# Reinforcement Learning using gymnasium and pytorch
This repo contains my implementation of RL using Q-Learning of the gymnasium cart-pole environemnt. 
I then followed the turorial from the docs of pytorch to implement DQN to complete the same task

## gym.py
Contains my implementation of Q-Learning 

## gymtorch.py
Contans the tutorial from pytorch from this page:
